            <strong>Hey, I'm Keri</strong><br />I grew up in Ottawa and have been living in Halifax for the past four
            years. I’ve always had a passion for creating things but I’m excited to start this program and actually
            learn the methods and strategies behind what makes great design. <br />I have a background in Media Studies
            from Western University which primarily focused on theory and research. Believe it or not, I came out of
            high school thinking that getting a PHD would be really cool and super fun! However, the pandemic had other
            plans and interrupted all of that. <br />Man, am I grateful it did because I am much happier where I am now
            learning about graphic design than reading pretentious theory for hours and hours.
